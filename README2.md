# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a *Linear Regression model* to predict house prices based on:
- Square footage of living area (GrLivArea)
- Number of bedrooms (BedroomAbvGr)
- Number of bathrooms (FullBath)

The dataset is taken from the [Kaggle House Prices competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

## ⚙ Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy (data handling)
- Scikit-learn (model training)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

## 📊 Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset (train.csv).
2. Selected key features (square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms).
3. Split the data into *training* and *testing* sets.
4. Trained a *Linear Regression model*.
5. Evaluated the model using:
   - R² Score
   - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
6. Visualized *Actual vs Predicted Prices* with a red line for perfect prediction.

## 📈 Results
- R² Score: ~ (depends on run)
- RMSE: ~ (depends on run)
- Scatter plot shows predictions vs actual values.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the project in *Google Colab*.
2. Upload the train.csv dataset.
3. Run the notebook cells step by step.
4. View the evaluation metrics and plots.
